# RayCasting_Render

'this is the raycaster_render from my side' 

..genrate_world is used to genrate walls for the render and save them as numpy arrays so that later raycasting_render can use them

..cuurently just a prototype made for fun may extent it to include other also and make a complete fpv shooter using this :).......
